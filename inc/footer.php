                <span class="f__title">The iGaming Design Agency With a Fresh Vision</span>
                <p class="f__text">
                    We have seen the need for an independent creative agency that can supply companies with modern iGaming design. Something that is detached from the things we have all seen many times over the past two to three decades. A fresh eye with today's and tomorrow's trends in mind. This is why iGaming Studio was born and launched in 2018. Design and technology change quickly, and iGaming has always been a slow responder to these changes. We wanted to challenge that and offer iGaming design services that are inspired by what is coming and not what has already been done.<br>
                    We are not looking at the competition for inspiration; we aim to inspire with our dedication to always deliver at the highest levels.<br>
                    iGaming Studio first launched as a small creative studio that quickly got clients with its new vision for the industry.</p>
                <span class="f__title">iGaming Design That is Proven to Work</span>
                <p class="f__text">
                    Our work proved several times that modern design can be very effective for iGaming companies, and this can also be backed up with the several design and development awards iGS has won over the years since its establishment.<br>
                    This also proves that the quality that our agency delivers meets the highest standards that the global design community holds. As a matter of fact, for any industry, not just iGaming.<br>
                    iGS is a multi-talented creative agency that offers everything that will help your company reach its goals or even surpass them. You can build your brand with iGaming Studio in a few months. From zero to hero, with a look that will quickly establish its legitimacy in the industry.<br>
                    Our streamlined development process ensures that what we hand over as a final product will be loved by search engines. Our fully SEO-optimized development process contributes greatly to our clients' improved search engine visibility.

                <span class="f__title">A Creative Agency for the Online Gambling Industry</span>
                <p class="f__text">
                    While different agencies do exist in the field, most of them focus on marketing and other areas of our industry, and the creative part was missing till iGS was established in 2018.<br>
                    Why was there any need for a specialised creative agency? iGaming is an industry that prefers to work with like-minded people who know our industry for many years and have experience in many areas.<br>
                    Understanding how iGaming works is key to delivering creative solutions that are also effective in capturing players and visitors attention. Knowing what is effective and what isn't can only be learnt by working many years in our field.<br>
                    This is why we are laser-focused on the iGaming industry with our creative agency, and very rarely work on projects that do not fall in the online gambling and its related (e.g., recruitment) business categories.<br>
                    Our agency is well-prepared for iGaming's expansion into different fields like competitive gaming, mixed reality, AI, and crypto, and we are well aware of what happens in the world and how it shapes what we call online gambling.
                </p>
                <span class="f__title">Step into the Future With iGaming Studio</span>
                <p class="f__text">
                    iGaming design in the past was mostly inspired by the direct competition, and after iGS was born as the first creative agency, we have seen that not only our clients but several other companies started to focus more on a modern iGaming look.<br>
                    This may or may not be the ripple effect of what our creative agency was born to do, but it is certainly making us happy.<br>
                    Simplicity in design has different purposes: something that is designed the way we do is easier to use. What we do is not just about looks; it is also about the experience visitors have. The reason they will visit again and again.<br>
                    We work in an industry where most operators offer more or less the same services, so differentiating is pretty much a must. To stand out in a good way, a product requires a sharp eye and a modern approach to iGaming design.<br>
                    Affiliates can also benefit greatly from a good layout; it can be a game changer. It is way better to start a casino or sportsbook affiliate site with a modern look than try to change it later when the site already has traffic. No affiliate wants to risk a well-established site's ranking on search engine result pages, even if they know the change could potentially gain even more traffic for them.<br>
                    A forward-looking approach is here for the iGaming industry. Will your iGaming product become the next big thing? We can certainly help you with that.
